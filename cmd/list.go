	Use list to show all or part of the assets registered
	in the notary dapp. For example:

	notary list -o owner     list assets registered by "owner"

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// listCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	listCmd.Flags().StringP("owner", "o", "", "Show only assets of this owner")
}
